# Course-Careers-Project2# Changing Your IP Address Using a VPN

This repository serves as a guide to changing your IP address using a VPN. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server, effectively changing your IP address to match that of the VPN server. 

## Why Change Your IP Address?
- **Privacy**: Hide your actual location and avoid tracking.
- **Bypass geo-restrictions**: Access content available only in other regions.
- **Security**: Use public Wi-Fi networks without exposing your actual IP.
