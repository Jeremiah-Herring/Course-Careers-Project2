This repository serves as a guide to changing your IP address using a VPN. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server, effectively changing your IP address to match that of the VPN server. 

## Why Change Your IP Address?
- **Privacy**: Hide your actual location and avoid tracking.
- **Bypass geo-restrictions**: Access content available only in other regions.
- **Security**: Use public Wi-Fi networks without exposing your actual IP.

## 4. Launch the VPN App and Log In
Open the app and log in using your credentials. This may involve setting up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) if your VPN provider offers it.

## 5. Select a Server Location
Most VPNs allow you to choose the server location. Select a country or city where you want your new IP address to originate from.

## 6. Connect to the VPN
Once you’ve selected your desired server, click **Connect**. The VPN will establish a secure connection, and your IP address will change to that of the server.
